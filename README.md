# FabFlix Project 1

## Non Main Branches used:
- ## Project 2 - branch name: "project2-branch"
- ## Project 3 - branch name: "project3-branch"

## Overview
FabFlix is a dynamic web application that provides users with detailed information about movies and stars. The project is built using **Java Servlets** for backend logic to handle HTTP requests and interact with a MySQL database. The frontend is powered by **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. **AJAX** calls are used to retrieve data asynchronously from the server without reloading the page, offering a seamless user experience.

### Features Implemented:
- **Movie List Page**: Displays the top 20 rated movies, including movie title, year, director, genres, stars, and rating.
- **Single Movie Page**: Provides detailed information about a specific movie, including its title, year, director, genres, and the list of stars.
- **Single Star Page**: Shows information about a particular star, including the movies they have been a part of.

### Backend:
- **Java Servlets**: Handle requests from the frontend and retrieve data from the database.
- **MySQL Database**: Stores movie, genre, and star information, which is retrieved dynamically by the servlets.

### Frontend:
- **HTML/CSS**: For layout and styling.
- **JavaScript (AJAX)**: Handles asynchronous calls to the backend servlets to fetch data and update the page dynamically.
